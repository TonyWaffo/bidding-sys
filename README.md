Auto Bidding is the easiest way to bid on a product auction. Just enter the highest price you're willing to pay for an item, and we'll do the rest.

Once you've set up automatic auctions, you can stay ahead of the competition for an item without having to be on the product's site.

How to set up automatic auctions
When you're ready to bid on an auction listing, enter the maximum amount you want to pay for the item and select Place a bid. We will then bid on your behalf gradually - enough to keep you one step ahead, but only up to your limit.

We will let you know if someone outbids you and you can decide if you want to increase your maximum limit.

Keep in mind that when deciding on the maximum amount you want to pay, you will also need to pay for the shipping costs.

advice
Bidding on items can be exciting, but it's a contractual obligation. When deciding your maximum bid, make sure that you are willing to pay that amount if you win the auction.

Why are you bidding immediately
If you outbid immediately after placing a bid, it's likely that another bidder is using automatic bidding and has a higher max limit than yours. You will have to bid again to be the highest bidder.

Bid increments
When someone else places a bid, we'll place a slightly higher bid on your behalf. The amount of the bid increase is called the bid increment. Bid increments are smaller when the bid price is low, and larger in the higher price ranges.


Sometimes you will see the bids go lower and lower. This means that someone else has placed a bid that is slightly more than your automatic bid amount.

Best takeaways
When someone else bids, we'll place a slightly higher bid on your behalf to keep you one step ahead.
